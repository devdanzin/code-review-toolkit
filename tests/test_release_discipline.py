"""Release discipline -- improvement-plan item 0.6.

The incident this exists to prevent: `python-pitfall-scanner` and
`test-investigation-agent` were added to the repo but no release was cut, so the
installed plugin genuinely did not contain them and both were invisible to the
agent registry for an entire session. Nothing in a repository can detect that a
user has not updated; what it CAN do is make adding an agent impossible to do
silently.

`_EXPECTED` below is that tripwire. Adding or removing an agent, command, or
script fails these tests, and the fix is to update the count **and bump
`plugins/code-review-toolkit/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** so the change reaches
an installed plugin. That is the whole mechanism -- deliberately annoying, in
proportion to a defect that cost a session.

The rest of the module checks the wiring that makes an agent reachable at all:
valid frontmatter, a name matching its filename, dispatch from a command, and
existence of everything the shape catalog points at.
