"""Run mypy against a project and report the type errors that indicate defects.

**One checker, its own config, one extra flag.** That is the whole design, and it
is a measured conclusion rather than a preference (docs/decision-log.md D-03).
Across three corpora, mypy on the project's own config found 0 / 0 / 61 errors
while pyright, ty and pyrefly found 60 / 50 / 1463 and 90 / 51 / 1266 and
18 / 25 / 53. **Every consensus cluster among the other three was a shared blind
spot** -- all ten in `_pyrepl` were `if False:` TYPE_CHECKING blocks that only
mypy special-cases; seven of ten in coverage.py were `hasattr()`-guarded
assignments that only mypy narrows. Consensus-among-the-others means *mypy is
right and the others are misconfigured*, so cross-referencing checkers is
anti-correlated with truth and this script does not do it.

The load-bearing addition is a single flag. On coverage.py, plain mypy reports 0
errors and ``--disallow-any-unimported`` reports **exactly 3, all in one file**,
every one caused by `from coverage.plugins import FileReporter` -- a module that
does not exist. The same flag on `_pyrepl` adds **0**. It is a real finding, not
a flag that fires everywhere. It runs as a labelled SECOND pass so the baseline
count stays honest.

Two hard rules learned the same way:

* **``files_checked == 0`` is reported as FAILED, not clean.** A checker whose
  config discovery excluded the tree reports success having analyzed nothing.
  pyrefly does exactly this on idlelib -- `0 errors`, exit 0.
* **Stale-ignore counts come only from mypy's own ``unused-ignore`` code.**
  Never from grep. Grepping `# type: ignore` and calling the total "stale
  ignores" is precisely the false alarm that produced a "36 stale ignores"
  claim with no evidence behind it.

``ty`` and ``pyrefly`` are deliberately NOT integrated. ``ty`` is experimental;
``pyrefly``'s silent-zero mode makes a clean result indistinguishable from a
misconfigured one, which is the one failure this script exists to prevent.
