"""Cross-reference a catalog of known findings against a fresh scan.

Answers one question: **of the findings we already know about, which are still
in this tree?** It is static and drift-tolerant -- it runs the scanner, not the
repros.

Keyed on ``(file, shape, qualname)``, never on line numbers. Python's `ast`
gives stable qualified names, so a finding whose line moved is still `present`
rather than a spurious `absent` plus a spurious new finding. This is the whole
reason the sibling C toolkit needs a `line_drifted` verdict and this one does
not.

**The caveat that must survive into every report:** an `absent` verdict is NOT
proof of a fix. Of the 90 catalogued shapes, **32 are `agent-only`** -- they are
confirmed by cross-artifact judgement, not by a scanner check, so a fresh scan
cannot see them at all and will report every one of them `absent`. Those are
emitted as `not_scannable` and are excluded from the fix count, but the same
caution applies to any shape whose instance carries no local token.

Catalog format is the findings repo's `known_findings.tsv`:

    # id	location	shape	severity	status
    CRF-COVPY-0001	sqldata.py:390	fix-not-propagated-to-sibling-path	FIX	reproduced

``location`` may be ``file.py:12``, ``file.py:12-18`` or ``file.py:12,20``.

Usage:
    python check_known_findings.py [scope] --catalog PATH [--max-files N]
