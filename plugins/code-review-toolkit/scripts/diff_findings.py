"""Diff two report directories -- the false-positive regression gate.

A "report directory" is what a run leaves in ``reports/<target>_v<n>/``: one
``<script>.json`` per analysis script. This script compares two of them and
answers the only question a regression gate needs: **what is new, what is gone,
and what merely moved?**

Findings are keyed WITHOUT line numbers. A finding that shifted because lines
were inserted above it is the same finding, and a gate that calls it "gone" plus
"added" reports two regressions where there were none. Line numbers are still
carried, so a keyed match with a different line is reported as ``moved``.

Every list compared is registered explicitly in ``_FINDING_LISTS`` below rather
than sniffed, because a heuristic that silently stops recognising a list would
make a regression look like an improvement. Anything unregistered, unreadable, or
present in only one of the two runs is reported in ``notes`` -- the denominator is
part of the answer.
