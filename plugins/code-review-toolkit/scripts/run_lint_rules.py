"""Run a pinned, explicitly-tiered ruff selection and report defect-grade findings.

This is NOT a linter pass. It is a *defect* pass that happens to use ruff as the
engine: the tiers below select the rules that mean "this code is wrong", and
deliberately exclude the ~95% of ruff that means "this code is unfashionable".
Measured over idlelib / `_pyrepl` / coverage.py, the previous untiered selection
(`F,B,SIM,S,RET,PIE,UP,PERF`) produced 610 / 124 / 259 findings of which
65% / 73% / 92% were style-grade, while missing a quarter of the tier-1-grade
defects because it excluded `PL`, `RUF`, `DTZ` and `ASYNC` outright.

Design constraints, every one of them measured (see docs/decision-log.md D-10):

* **Pin the version.** ruff's default rule set went from 59 to 413 rules in
  0.16.0, and it is not a superset -- 18 rules were dropped. A ruff bump is a
  calibration event, so the version is recorded in every envelope and a mismatch
  against ``PINNED_RUFF_VERSION`` is reported rather than ignored.
* **Always an explicit ``--select``, never ``--extend-select``**, which composes
  with a default that just changed sevenfold.
* **JSON output only.** Concise output changed shape between versions *and*
  between preview modes, and 0.16.0's preview mode omits the rule code entirely.
* **Capture stderr.** Two staleness classes warn there and nowhere else: a
  remapped code (``'PGH001' has been remapped to 'S307'``) and a preview-gated
  selection having no effect.
* **No ``--preview``.** It mutates already-stable rules and carries no
  deprecation policy. ``--preview-pass`` runs the four preview-gated codes
  separately and labels their findings.
* **``rule_validation`` inspects ``status``, not membership.** Verified trap:
  removed rules (``RUF076``, ``UP038``, ``ANN101``) are still listed by
  ``ruff rule --all``, so a membership test passes for a deleted rule.

Two fields carry the design:

``shape_id``
    Non-null when the rule overlaps a catalogued bug shape. A finding with a
    shape_id should be MERGED with the scanner's finding at raised confidence,
    never double-reported.
``has_suppression_comment``
    Measured to be the strongest dismissal signal. Tier-1 precision is 50-70%,
    not 100%, and an existing suppression naming the rule class is usually why.

Usage:
    python run_lint_rules.py [path] [--tier 1|2|3] [--ruff-bin PATH]
                             [--preview-pass] [--max-findings N]
