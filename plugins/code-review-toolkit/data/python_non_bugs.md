# Python-review false-positive taxonomy

The recurring shapes a high-recall scanner or agent flags but a reviewer should **dismiss with a
reason**, plus how to tell each apart from the *real* bug it mimics. This is the reasoning companion
to `python_bug_shapes.json`; `build_informed_briefing.py` folds both into the informed-explore
briefing so agents stop re-triaging these from scratch.

Extend it as validation runs confirm new FP classes — that feedback is what calibrates the toolkit.
Each class: **symptom** (what gets flagged) → **why it's a non-bug** → **what the REAL bug looks
like** (so a genuine instance is never suppressed).

## Dead code / unused symbols

### 1. Dynamically-dispatched name
- **Symptom:** a function/method/class reported as unreferenced.
- **Why non-bug:** Python reaches it without a literal reference — `getattr(obj, name)`, a registry
  populated by decorator, `__init_subclass__`, entry points in `pyproject.toml`, a plugin loader,
  `globals()[name]`, Django/SQLAlchemy/pydantic model hooks, or a name only used in a template or
  config string.
- **Real bug:** genuinely nothing constructs the name — no decorator registry, no entry point, no
  string occurrence anywhere including non-Python files. **Grep the whole repo for the bare name
  (including `.toml`, `.cfg`, `.ini`, `.yaml`, `.html`) before reporting.**

### 2. Public API surface of a library
- **Symptom:** exported functions unreferenced *within* the package.
- **Why non-bug:** the consumers are downstream users, not this repo. Anything in `__all__`, or
  re-exported from `__init__.py`, is API by definition.
- **Real bug:** an internal helper (leading underscore, not in `__all__`, not re-exported) with no
  in-repo callers.

### 3. Protocol / ABC / override conformance
- **Symptom:** a method that "no one calls" — `__enter__`, `visit_*`, `do_GET`, `setUp`, an
  overridden base method.
- **Why non-bug:** the caller is the language, the framework, or a base class. Visitor methods
  (`ast.NodeVisitor.visit_*`), unittest fixtures, and dunder protocol methods are dispatched by name.
- **Real bug:** a `visit_X`/`do_X` whose suffix matches no real node type or verb — a typo'd hook
  that will never fire. That one IS worth reporting.

### 4. Test-only helper
- **Symptom:** a symbol used exclusively from `tests/`.
- **Why non-bug:** that is its purpose.
- **Real bug:** a symbol used by *nothing*, including tests.

## Error handling

### 5. Intentional narrow suppression
- **Symptom:** an `except ...: pass`.
- **Why non-bug:** it catches a *specific* exception it can legitimately ignore, and the intent is
  documented — `except FileNotFoundError: pass` around a best-effort cleanup, `contextlib.suppress`.
- **Real bug:** the suppressed type is broad (`Exception`/bare), or the body swallows an error the
  caller needed in order to be correct. See `bare-except-swallows-control-flow` for the
  `BaseException` variant, which is a real bug regardless of intent.

### 6. Re-raising boundary handler
- **Symptom:** a broad `except Exception:` at a top-level entry point.
- **Why non-bug:** it logs, adds context, and **re-raises** (or deliberately converts to an exit
  code at the true process boundary — a CLI `main()`, a request handler, a worker loop that must not
  die on one bad item).
- **Real bug:** the same shape with no re-raise and no logging, in the middle of a call stack, where
  the caller cannot tell the operation failed.

### 7. `logging.exception` inside the handler
- **Symptom:** an exception "swallowed" but logged.
- **Why non-bug:** at a genuine boundary, logging with traceback and continuing is the designed
  behavior.
- **Real bug:** logged at `debug`/`info` level, or logged without the traceback (`logger.error(str(e))`),
  so the failure is invisible in production — and control continues as if it succeeded.

---

## Complexity / structure

### 8. Inherently-complex dispatch
- **Symptom:** a function scoring high on branch count / cognitive complexity.
- **Why non-bug:** it is a flat dispatch table — a long `match`/`if-elif` over opcodes, token types,
  or message kinds, or generated/vendored code. Splitting it would *reduce* readability.
- **Real bug:** deep NESTING (4+ levels) mixing distinct concerns, or a long function where extract-
  method would produce independently-nameable units. Judge nesting depth over raw length.

### 9. Parser / state machine
- **Symptom:** high complexity in a tokenizer, parser, or protocol decoder.
- **Why non-bug:** state machines are irreducibly branchy; the complexity is essential, not accidental.
- **Real bug:** a state machine whose states are implicit in ad-hoc booleans rather than an enum —
  that is a real refactor target.

---

## Types

### 10. Deliberate `Any` at a boundary
- **Symptom:** `Any` flagged as weak typing.
- **Why non-bug:** it sits at a genuinely dynamic edge — deserialized JSON, `**kwargs` passthrough,
  a decorator wrapping arbitrary callables, or a C-extension boundary.
- **Real bug:** `Any` on an internal function whose actual type is known and stable, especially when
  a `TypedDict`/dataclass for that shape already exists in the codebase.

### 11. Missing annotations in a deliberately-untyped area
- **Symptom:** low annotation coverage.
- **Why non-bug:** the project is gradually typed and this module is explicitly excluded in
  `pyproject.toml`/`mypy.ini`, or it is test code where annotations add little.
- **Real bug:** an unannotated *public* API in a package that otherwise ships `py.typed`.

---

## Consistency / patterns

### 12. Justified local divergence
- **Symptom:** one module handles a concern differently from the majority.
- **Why non-bug:** the divergence has a reason — a performance-critical path, a compatibility shim
  for an older Python, or a deliberate migration in progress (new pattern being rolled out).
- **Real bug:** divergence with no rationale, where the two variants have *different behavior* on
  edge cases (error handling, encoding, path separators) — behavioral divergence outranks stylistic.

### 13. Vendored / generated code
- **Symptom:** any finding inside `_vendor/`, `third_party/`, `*_pb2.py`, `*.generated.py`, migrations.
- **Why non-bug:** not this project's code to change; regenerating overwrites edits.
- **Real bug:** none here — but a *stale vendored copy with a known CVE* is worth raising separately
  as a dependency finding, not a code finding.

---

## Documentation

### 14. Intentionally-terse docstring
- **Symptom:** a one-line or missing docstring flagged.
- **Why non-bug:** the function is a trivial, self-describing accessor, a private helper, or an
  override whose contract is documented on the base class.
- **Real bug:** a docstring that is **wrong** — documents parameters that no longer exist, states a
  return type that changed, or describes behavior the body contradicts. Stale beats absent as a
  finding: absent docs mislead nobody.

---

## Git history

### 15. Churn from mechanical change
- **Symptom:** a file topping the churn/risk ranking.
- **Why non-bug:** the churn is formatting, a lint sweep, a mass rename, dependency bumps, or a
  license-header change — high line counts, zero semantic risk.
- **Real bug:** churn concentrated in *bug-fix* commits touching the same function repeatedly. Read
  the commit subjects before ranking; `fix:`/`hotfix` density is the signal, not raw line count.
